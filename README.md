# NYCTaxiTripDurationPrediction
This report is based on the dataset from a competition on the Kaggle website, which challenges people to analyze and build a model that predicts the total ride duration of taxi trips in New York City. provides a suitable and meaningful place for data miners. For this dataset we are working on, it required us to make predictions from not only analysis on different featured variables but also build and train three complete different models to explore our ideas for data science and test the implementation of our previous learning.In this competition, the challenge is to predict the total ride duration of taxi trips in New York City. The primary dataset is released by the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission and our dataset has been prepared and simplified with only partial covariates of the original dataset by Simon Zhou.
